An Interactive Fiction by Daniele Maccari
Release 1 / Serial number 190526 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Bedroom
You are in your room. It&apos;s got a strange vibe, as if each of the previous tenants left something of their own in it. But you got used to it, and now it&apos;s just your room. You are sitting at your tiny desk -- some oddly shaped table from IKEA or something -- staring at some text on the screen of your laptop. You have been trying to read the same paragraph for the last five minutes, but the words seem to be slipping away from you as soon as you hop from one to the next while playing your inner monologue.  To your left, the only painted wall stands out lonely; it&apos;s a dark blue, although the hue is light enough for the color to still be recognizable, at least in daylight. From outside, you can hear some birds chirping, and sunlight glides in through the large, wall-wide window behind you, gifting your back with a nice, cozy feeling of warmth. To the east the only door leads to a small landing.

A plain-looking, creamy painted door leads  to the landing.

Landing
A small landing providing access to the rooms on the second floor of the house. East you can see the bathroom, but the door is locked. You can hear the water in the shower running, but the light is off. Weird.

A small landing providing access to the rooms on the second floor of the house. To the right you can see the bathroom; you can tell the door have been locked from the inside from the old-fashioned bolt lock. You can see no light coming from the small glass pane above the door. The light is off as well, but you can hear the water in the shower running. Weird.

A plain-looking, creamy painted door leads back to the bedroom.

Another door leads to the bathroom. You can see a bolt lock next to the handle.

The Landing
A small landing providing access to the rooms on the second floor of the house. To the right you can see the bathroom; you can tell the door have been locked from the inside because the old-fashioned turning lock is set on red. You can see no light coming from the small glass pane above the door; they probably did not even bother to raise the shutter. The light is off as well, but you can hear the water in the shower running. Weird.

A plain-looking, creamy painted door leads to the landing.

You are in your room. It&apos;s got a strange vibe, as if each of the previous tenants left something of their own in it. But you got used to it, and now it&apos;s just your room. You are sitting at your tiny desk -- some oddly shaped table from IKEA or something -- staring at some text on the screen of your laptop. You have been trying to read the same paragraph for the last five minutes, but the words seem to be slipping away from you as soon as you hop from one to the next while playing your inner monologue.  To your left, the only painted wall stands out lonely; it&apos;s a dark blue, although the hue is light enough for the color to still be recognizable, at least in daylight. From outside, you can hear some birds chirping, and sunlight glides in through the large, wall-wide window behind you, gifting your back with a nice, cozy feeling of warmth. To the east the only door leads to a small landing.
